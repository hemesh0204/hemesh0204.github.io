# About Me
I am a Computer Science Engineer specializing in data science, but I have been expanding my knowledge to include database architecture, machine learning, and front-end development. I am pursuing my master's in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington. Since I was young, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. This passion drives my approach to big data sets: to me, they are large puzzles waiting to be solved. I relish the challenge of finding patterns that others might overlook. Lastly, I have an insatiable love for learning. Every day, I strive to learn something new, whether it's about machine learning, software engineering, or fascinating facts about the universe.

- Developed a robust resume parsing algorithm with NLP, achieving 95% accuracy in extracting work experience, projects, education, skills, and key highlights, reducing manual effort by 60%.
- Employed data cleaning and ranking pipelines for 93% accurate job matching.
- Built and integrated an HR chatbot using Django, enhancing candidate screening and improving recruitment efficiency.

### **Data Analyst Intern @ The Sparks Foundation (_August 2021 - September 2021_)**
- Conducted EDA on US supermarkets using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, and Plotly, identifying operational inefficiencies and reducing inventory costs by 20%.
- Leveraged insights from top-performing areas to make data-driven recommendations for improvement.
- Identified top-performing areas within the supermarket and analyzed the factors contributing to their success.


# Projects

### **[Football Analysis](https://github.com/hemesh0204/football-analysis) | Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, Pytorch, KMeans (_May 2024 - September 2024_)**
- Built an AI-powered football analysis system using YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and tracking of players, referees, and the ball in match footage.
- Applied KMeans clustering to accurately assign players to teams based on jersey colour, integrating optical flow for camera movement detection and tracking corrections.
- Leveraged perspective transformation to compute player speed and distance covered, producing performance metrics in real-world units.
  
### **Algae Classification | Python, TensorFlow (_January 2024 - May 2024_)**
- Microscopic algae image data was processed from a FlowCam DB dump by the City of Bloomington, including augmentation to enhance dataset quality.
- Implemented and evaluated CNN, AlexNet, and ViT models, achieving 98% top-5 classification accuracy, and enhancing algae identification reliability.
- The model was deployed in the Bloomington government office, integrated with human and statistical predictions, and added to a pipeline from preprocessing to result display, reducing bacteria identification time by 50%.

### **Mental Health Prediction | Python, Sklearn, TensorFlow (_May 2021 - June 2021_)**
- Built a predictive model using machine learning to assess mental health status based on diverse behavioural and demographic data, enabling early intervention.
- Applied advanced data preprocessing techniques to the Kaggle dataset, employing a range of models including regression, classification, decision trees, and boosting.
- Developed an ADA Boost model with a commendable 81% accuracy rate.

### **Movie Ticket Booking Application | MERN Stack, Stripe (_January 2024 - May 2024_)**
- Developed a comprehensive theatre management application with separate interfaces for Users, Admins, and Theatre Owners, incorporating JWT Authentication and BCrypt password hashing.
